The NLOs where asked:

**How would you define the degree to which the TCP has contributed in achieving results in each are of support in your country**.

This question was asked separately across FOAs and five different time periods.

The following charts show: 

* The maximum level of contribution across FOAs.
* The FOAs for which the NLOs have reported an increase of development stage due to the support of the TCP.


## Maximum level of development reported

```{r, results='asis'}

cat('### By FOA\n\n')

cat(glue('![]({dir_plts_relevance_theme}/between_foas.png)'), "\n\n")


cat('### By FOA and Region\n\n')

cat(glue('![]({dir_plts_relevance_theme}/between_foas_region.png)'),"\n\n")
#cat(glue("![](", full_path, ")"), "\n")

## Increase of stage





```{r, results='asis'}

cat('### By FOA\n\n')

cat(glue('![]({dir_plts_relevance_theme}/stages_increase.png)'), "\n\n")


cat('### By region\n\n')

cat(glue('![]({dir_plts_relevance_theme}/stages_increase_region.png)'), "\n\n")
