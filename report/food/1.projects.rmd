## Number of Projects Across FOAs


The coding system of the FOAs has varied over time. To have a consistent coding, the analytical team grouped the FOAs to create a new coding system. Moreover, each FOA is expected to produce a certain improvement. Thus, the FOAs can also be grouped across improvements. 


```{r, results='asis'}
