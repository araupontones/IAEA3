During the NLO 1 survey, the respondents were asked their opinion about the importance that the TCP will have to contribute in achieving results in the supported countries over the next 5-10 years. This question was asked separately for each of the 23 Field of Activities (FoA) across the 6 different Thematic Areas.

The question was the following:

*To the best of your knowledge, how important will the contribution of the TC programme be in achieving results in the following areas in your country over the next 5-10 years?*

Although the perception of the importance that the TCP will have in the future was asked separately for each FoA, the results can be aggregated at different levels of aggregation:

* By and between Thematic Areas,
* By and betwen regions,
* By and between LDCs.


Thus, the this section aims to compare the perception that the NLOs have about the importance of the TCP in achieving results in their countries over the next 5-10 years. The section is divided as follows: It first compares the future perspective between Themes and across regions (using different region categories) ^[The countries are grouped using 3 different categories: 1) Geographical Region, 2) LDC status, 3) The time period in which they were supported.].
