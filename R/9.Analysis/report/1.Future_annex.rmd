The following graphs show the perception that the NLOs have about the influence that the TCP will have in achieving results within each Field of Activity of each of the 6 Thematic Areas.

The graphs are expressed in the proportion of respondents that consider how the influence of the TCP will be.

```{r, results='asis'}
#perspective for FOAs

sufixes <- c("fa", "h", "e", "i", "w", "n")

#subtitle for each thematic area
for(foa in sufixes){
  
  #get the name of the Thematic Arwa
  tema <- names_themes(foa)
  
  #Assign a subtitle
  cat(paste0('## ',tema, "\n" ))
  
  #fetch all the plots of this thematic area
  plots_tema <-  plots_by_themes[str_detect(plots_by_themes, glue('^{foa}_'))]
  
  #display the plots
  for(plot in plots_tema){
    
    #get the full path of the plot
    full_path <- file.path(dir_section_plots, plot)
    
    cat(glue("![](", full_path, ")"), "\n")
    cat("\n")
    
    
  }
  
  
  
}
